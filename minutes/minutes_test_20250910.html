            <h2>AI Suggestions for Improvement</h2>
            <ac:structured-macro ac:name="note" ac:schema-version="1">
                <ac:rich-text-body>
                    <p>1. Assign action items: Ensure that action items are clearly identified and assigned at the end of each meeting. This will help drive accountability and progress between meetings.

2. Address blockers proactively: Encourage attendees to raise any potential blockers or challenges they foresee during the meeting, so they can be addressed in real-time and not hinder progress later on.

3. Consider inviting additional stakeholders: Evaluate if key stakeholders are missing from the meeting who could contribute valuable insights or help move projects forward more effectively.</p>
